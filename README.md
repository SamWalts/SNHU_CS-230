# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was a gaming company that wanted to broaden their audience from android to being available on all platforms. The way to do that was by using web browsers in order for the game to be accessed through all of the devices that they required.
# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think what I did best was defining the different types of operating systems and their constraints.
# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document allowed me to more easily see the roadmap required. I could easily pick up where I left off from day to day, because I could follow along on my design document.
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think that I would revise the server portion. I only have surface level knowledge of servers, and that would be a good thing to learn more about.
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
By considering the design as a series of "user stories" I was able to think like the end user. What would I need for the end user to have a great expierence, and then I would go ahead and plan out the engineering portion with my user in mind.
# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
For designing software, I liked to list all my requirements. Once I do that, then going to a flowchart such as LucidChart helped me get my ideas out. While coding I would keep my list of requirements, and my flow chart available for reference. By keeping my progress tied to the flowchart, I can replicate a software like Jira, where I can keep track of my work from project to project. Not to mention that proper research and design means less spaghetti code.
